**Effective techniques for performing smarter geospatial analysis using location intelligence**

## What is this book about?
Data scientists, who have access to vast data streams, are a bit myopic when it comes to intrinsic and extrinsic location-based data and are missing out on the intelligence it can provide to their models. This book demonstrates effective techniques for using the power of data science and geospatial intelligence to build effective, intelligent data models that make use of location-based data to give useful predictions and analyses.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Learn how companies now use location data
* Set up your Python environment and install Python geospatial packages
* Visualize spatial data as graphs
* Extract geometry from spatial data
* Perform spatial regression from scratch

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from shapely.geometry import Point
for lat, lon in zip(nyc['Latitude'][:5], nyc['Longtitude'][:5]):
   geometry = Point(lat, lon)
    print(geometry)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Data Scientists who would like to leverage location-based data and want to use location-based intelligence in their data models will find this book useful. This book is also for GIS developers who wish to incorporate data analysis in their projects. Knowledge of Python programming and some basic understanding of data analysis are all you need to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-07).
